# Create-React-App Start Kit, With Extras and Examples	

#### Redux | Redux Thunk | React Router4 | Firebase | ReactBootstrap | MaterialsUI

This start kit is based on one react-starter3 and the in-progress "feedbackr"

This is mainly for my own use at this point and is still being tweaked, so please forgive any rough spots or unexplained details
